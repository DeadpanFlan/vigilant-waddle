## Done
- [x] Work on Displaying things (init Shaders and Buffers) in WebGL2
- [x] Displaying a Pyramid, next thing would be a Camera to look around
- [x] Folder for storing OBJ files added

## Next Up
- Implement Camera
	- Camera started, needs to handle mouse and keyboard movements
	- Implement Pointerlock so mouse events only apply to when locked to canvas
	- Still need to handle key events
- Investigate [Obj to JS](https://github.com/chrispalazzolo/objtojs/blob/master/index.js) 
	- Started working on my own version
